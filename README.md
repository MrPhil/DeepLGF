# DeepLGF: Deep Learning Framework for Predicting Drug-Drug Interactions Using Local-Global Information Based on Biological Knowledge Graph
A deep learning-based DDIs predictor



## Data details
This paper includes four datasets that DS1, DS2, D-DS3 and E-DS3 processed from reference [1-3] . Each dataset file contains the three feature files and the results of proposed model.  Furthermore, There are examples of saving models each fold in the path of " '*dataset name*' /  '*method*.h5' ".
