# A Biomedical Knowledge Graph based Method for Drug-drug Interactions Prediction through Combining Local and Global Features with Deep Neural Networks
A deep learning-based DDIs predictor



# Data details
This paper includes four datasets that DS1, DS2, D-DS3 and E-DS3 processed from reference [1-3] . Each dataset file contains the three feature files and the results of proposed model.  Furthermore, There are examples of saving models each fold in the path of " '*dataset name*' /  '*method*.h5' ".


# Requirements
python==3.8.5 tensorflow-gpu==2.2.0 pandas==1.2.4 numpy==1.20.2 keras==2.4.3 gensim==4.0.1 tqdm==4.63.0 h5py==2.10.0


# Usage
We provided the example to run our code in the fold of " 'example' /  'test.py' ".
